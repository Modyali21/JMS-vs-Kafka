# JMS-vs-Kafka
## ðŸ“¬ Message Queues in Data-Intensive Applications
  Nowadays, message queues are ubiquitous in modern data-driven systems.
They enable reactive programming, allowing services to submit messages and maintain responsiveness.
## ðŸ§© Two Popular Message Queuing Systems
### ðŸ”· Java Message Service (JMS)
* A messaging standard for Java EE.

* Enables:

  * Loosely coupled communication

  * Asynchronous and reliable messaging

  * Standardized APIs for message creation, sending, and receiving

###  ðŸ”¶ Apache Kafka
* A distributed event store and stream-processing platform.

* Developed by the Apache Software Foundation.

* Key features:

  * High-throughput, low-latency architecture

  * Open-source, written in Java and Scala

  * Suitable for real-time data feeds


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
To explore the different paradigms offered by JMS and Kafka, this project simulates the decision-making process an organization would follow when choosing a messaging platform.

## ðŸ§ª What You'll Do:
* Try both JMS and Kafka

* Benchmark and compare their performance

* Analyze them based on:

  * Message latency

  * Throughput

  * Reliability

  * Suitability for your use case
